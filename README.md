# Zombie unity project

Building out the start of a rts/autobattler roguelike game, where the user controls/manages an army of zombies, fighting against other human armies, where you can infect and expand your army and specialize it overtime with mutations and tactics.

The main idea is to build a game where units have a plug and play finite state ai, where tactics and behavior can be simply added, giving the user some control like commands and more optimal behaviour, but mostly the fight plays out as an autobattler. Choices for upgrades and behavior/tactics will be given, in a typical rougelike style.
